Zero-shot Prompting:Zero-shot prompting is an AI technique where a model generates responses or performs tasks without prior training on specific examples, relying solely on its general understanding.
Few-shot prompting: Is an AI technique where a model is given a few examples of a task within the prompt to help it generate accurate responses or perform tasks, leveraging those examples to guide its output.
Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Is an AI technique where the model generates intermediate reasoning steps or explanations before arriving at a final answer, enhancing its ability to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler parts.
Self-consistency: Is an AI technique that involves generating multiple independent solutions to a problem and then selecting the most common or consistent answer, improving the reliability and accuracy of the final output.
Generate Knowledge Prompting: Is an AI technique where the model first generates relevant information or background knowledge about a given topic, which is then used to answer questions or perform tasks more effectively.
Prompt chaining: Is an AI technique where multiple prompts are sequentially used, with the output of one prompt serving as the input for the next, to guide the model through a complex task or multi-step process.
Tree of Thoughts: Is an AI technique where the model explores multiple potential solution paths in a tree-like structure, evaluating and branching out from each thought or step to find the most effective or accurate overall solution.
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Is an AI technique that combines a retrieval model to fetch relevant documents or data from an external source with a generation model to produce responses, enhancing the quality and accuracy of the generated content by grounding it in the retrieved information.
Directional Stimulus Prompting: Is an AI technique where specific hints or cues are provided within the prompt to guide the model toward generating responses that follow a desired direction or meet particular criteria.
ReAct Prompting (Reasoning and Acting): Is an AI technique where the model alternates between reasoning steps and taking actions, allowing it to iteratively refine its approach and solutions to a problem, enhancing its problem-solving capabilities.
Multimodal CoT Prompting: Is an AI technique where the model integrates multiple modalities, such as text, images, and possibly other forms of data, to generate coherent chains of reasoning or explanations, thereby improving its ability to understand and respond to complex, multimodal inputs.
